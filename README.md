EFDataMappingKit
================

Mapping data from an API to a database. Serializing objects to persistent storage. In most data heavy applications we are constantly converting from one type of data to another. 

REST apis are beautiful and easily parsed, but even with pure REST apis there is hardly ever a clean 1 on 1 mapping between what you get from the server and what you process inside the app.

We've been using some simple mapping mechanisms that allow us to easily and declaratively map data from one format to another. 

We'll have to add documentation and it's far from ready, but we thought we'd share it anyway because it may benefit others.
